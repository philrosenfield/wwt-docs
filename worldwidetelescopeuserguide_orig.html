<p>The WorldWide Telescope is a software environment that enables your 
computer to function as a virtual telescope, combining terabytes of imagery from such famous 
telescopes as Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer into one vast panorama of the 
universe.</p>
<p>WorldWide Telescope allows seamless panning and zooming around the 
night sky, our Solar System, and other space-orientated panoramas, such as the 
pictures taken of the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. <a href="#Exploring">Explore</a> the sky at multiple wavelengths: 
see the 
x-ray view of the sky and zoom into bright radiation clouds, and then cross-fade 
into the visible light view and discover the cloud remnants of a supernova 
explosion from a thousand years ago. Switch to the Hydrogen Alpha view to see 
the distribution and illumination of massive primordial hydrogen cloud 
structures lit up by the high energy radiation coming from nearby stars in the 
Milky Way.</p>
<p>For a dazzling educational experience, our Solar System is modeled in three 
dimensions, with the planets rotating and orbiting the Sun. Watch the majestic 
beauty of Saturn&#39;s rings or the distant orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto as they 
track across the sky in their accurately modeled days and years. Accelerate the simulated time to plan a visit to the best 
spot for the next solar or lunar eclipse. </p>

<p>Newcomers to WorldWide Telescope are recommended to browse 
the growing number of <a href="#GuidedTours">Guided Tours</a> of the sky by 
astronomers and educators from some of the most respected observatories and 
planetariums. Most of the features can be discovered simply by using the 
program. This documentation is provided as a resource to help describe what is 
going on, and to help locate the features that this project has to offer. There 
are two versions of WorldWide Telescope, a Windows application and a web client. This documentation set describes both, where 
necessary indicating where a feature only applies to one. The essential 
differences between the two are that the Windows version is downloaded and 
installed first, 
then run, and has a few more features. The web client is not downloaded and 
installed, is 
based on HTML5, and has fewer features but can be customized.</p>

<p><em>WorldWide Telescope is created by Microsoft Research using the Microsoft 
high performance Visual Experience Engine , and the project is dedicated&nbsp; 
to legendary researcher Jim Gray, without whom this project would not have 
happened. WorldWide Telescope is released as a free resource to the astronomy 
and education community with the hope that it will inspire and empower people to 
explore and understand the universe like never before.</em></p>

<h3><a name="TheTopPanel">The Top Panel</a></h3>


<p>Along the top of the screen is the main menu, with entries <strong>Explore</strong>,
<strong>Guided Tours</strong>, <strong>Search</strong>, <strong>Community</strong>,
<strong>Telescope</strong>, <strong>View</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong>. 
These entries are described in detail later on in the documentation, however the 
basic purpose of each entry follows. Note that the main menu items can be 
clicked on themselves, which has a different function than selecting the down 
arrow and opening up the menu contents.</p>
<table class="T2" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="54" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ui_win_Main-Menu-Down-Arrow.png" width="195"></td><td>
	Hovering the mouse underneath the main menu item will display a down arrow. 
	Clicking on this down arrow will open up the menu contents. Clicking on the 
	main menu item itself (for example, clicking on the entry <strong>Explore</strong>) 
	will change the appearance of the top panel, and not display the menu 
	contents.</td></tr>
</table>

<ul>
<li class="main"><a href="#Exploring"><b>Explore</b></a>: The first two menu items, <strong>New</strong> and <strong>Open</strong>, are used to start new data files, or open existing data files,
respectively. These are the primary purposes of the <strong>Explore</strong> menu - the location of data to display. Clicking the 
<strong>Explore</strong> entry
itself will display the data <b>Collections</b> thumbnails across the top panel. 
Selecting any of these thumbnails will either open up a new set of thumbnails to 
browse, or change the view to display something new. These thumbnail images 
either reference individual items, or another set of items (similar to a folder 
and file structure). A set of images are 
referred to as <em>collections</em> in WorldWide Telescope.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#GuidedTours"><b>Guided Tours</b></a>: A tour in WorldWide Telescope is an animated, annotated slide-show, for educational, research or entertainment
purposes, usually focusing on a particular topic. Clicking the <b>Guided Tours</b> entry itself will display the <b>Tours</b> supplied by
default with the product in the top panel. The menu entries can be used to search for other tours on the web, and to create
a new tour. Opening a tour can also be done from the <b>Explore &gt; Open</b> sub-menu.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#TheSearchMenu"><b>Search</b></a>: Clicking on this main menu item itself will change the top panel to show a range of 
search parameters, that are used to search on the default data provided with the product. Opening up the <b>Search </b>menu will enable some internet based searches.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#Communities"><b>Community</b></a>: A community in WorldWide Telescope is a public or private group that can be set up to share data. Clicking
on the <b>Community</b> entry itself will display the <b>My Communities</b> entries in the top panel. This list will obviously be
empty the first time the product is used. Select <b>Join a Community</b> to be linked to a website with links to public
communities. Joining these communities will add them to your <b>My Communities</b> list, and give you a new collection of data, 
magazine articles, and so on, to browse and explore.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#TheTelescopeMenu"><b>Telescope</b></a>: This menu 
item should only be selected if you have a physical telescope that can be 
connected to your computer with a USB cable and has the appropriate software 
interface. If you have access to such a telescope this feature enables some 
interesting possibilities, including using WorldWide Telescope to identify or 
locate objects in the sky, and perhaps to add your own images into the mix.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#TheViewMenu"><b>View</b></a>: This menu item displays options to control the observing location and time. You can set WorldWide Telescope to show you the view from any location around the globe, using the current time or a time/date in the past or future.</li>
<li class="main"><a href="#TheSettingsMenu"><b>Settings</b></a>: Clicking on this menu item itself will display a range of settings, these are somewhat similar to the
View settings, controlling what is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Top Panel</i> is shown in the image below. It is a glass panel that 
displays a range of thumbnail images. Thumbnail
images are there to be clicked on, with the underlying text helping identity the data.</p>
<table class="T2" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="154" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ui_win_Top-Panel.png" width="539"></td><td>
	In this top panel view, the user has selected the thumbnail <strong>
	Constellations</strong>, so the top panel now displays all 89 constellation 
	entries. Astronomers will note that there are 88 constellations, however 
	WorldWide Telescope treats the divided Serpens constellation as two.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="102" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/TopPanelNext.jpg" width="221"></td><td>
		If there are more thumbnails than the top panel can display, the number 
		of rows of thumbnails (with <em>previous</em> and <em>next</em> arrows) 
		will appear to the far right of the panel. Select the arrows or use the 
		mouse wheel to scroll through the options.</td></tr>

<h3><a name="TheView">The View</a></h3>


<p>Underneath the top panel is the main view! In this case the user has selected 
<strong>Constellations</strong> then <strong>Cassiopeia</strong>:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="451" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/MainViewHeartNebula.jpg" width="1355"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>The images of the sky are annotated with the outlines of the constellations. The constellation most central to the view is
referred to as the <em>selected</em> <em>constellation</em>, and is outlined in yellow. The red lines display <i>figures</i> - in this case
linking the main stars that make up the constellation. Cassiopeia is of course known for the five 
bright stars making up the large
<i>W</i>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#TheViewMenu">View Menu</a> and the <a href="#TheViewMenu">Settings Menu</a> have 
options to change what lines are drawn, and their colors. The lines shown in the 
image above are the default for a sky view.</p>
<p>To navigate the main view the primary device is the mouse. Use the mouse wheel to zoom deep into outer space, and back. Hold
down the left mouse button and drag to change the angle of the view.</p>
<p>Clicking the right mouse button brings up the <a href="#TheFinderScope">Finder Scope</a>, which can be dragged around the screen with the mouse to help
identify objects. In the image below, it has been used to select one of the stars in Cassiopeia.</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

<h3><a name="TheLowerPanel">The Lower Panel</a></h3>


<p>At the bottom of the screen there is the lower panel. This performs a variety of functions, the most significant of which
are the <strong>Look At</strong> and <strong>Imagery</strong> entries.</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="45" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/LookAt.jpg" width="351"></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <b>Look At</b> list includes <b><a href="#ExploreEarth">Earth</a>, <a href="#ExplorePlanet">Planet</a>, 
<a href="#ExploreSky">Sky</a>, <a href="#ExplorePanorama">Panorama</a>,</b> and 
<b><a href="#ExploreSolarSystem">Solar System</a></b>. This is the highest
level list determining what to display. Selecting <strong>Solar</strong> <strong>System</strong> reveals the impressive 3D modeling of the 
Sun and Solar System
planets (this is not currently available in the web control version of WorldWide Telescope). The 
<strong>Imagery</strong> list gives the range
of data options given the selection made in the <strong>Look At</strong> list. For 
<strong>Solar System</strong> there is only one option. For <strong>Sky</strong> there is a large
range of options, as there are many different wavelengths of light that can be recorded, in addition to the visible wavelength
that we all see. Different wavelengths include x-ray, gamma, microwave, and so on. The most fascinating imagery is to most
people the visible wavelength, but studies of the other wavelengths can reveal more specific information about what is 
happening, or has
happened, to the stellar object.</p>
<p><strong>Panorama</strong> is an interesting and slightly different selection. The range of imagery for this includes the pictures taken from
different landing vehicles on the Moon and Mars. Selecting <strong>Earth</strong> gives the chance to examine our own planet closely, right down
to streets and small geographic features.</p>
<p>The selections made in the <strong>Look At</strong> and <strong>Imagery</strong> lists greatly affects the relevance of other options (the 
<a href="#TheViewMenu">View </a> and <a href="#TheViewMenu">Settings</a> entries, for example),
which are explained in detail later on in this guide.</p>
<p>Underneath these two list entries in the lower panel is the context list of thumbnails. A 
<a href="#ContextSearch">Context Search</a> is 
carried out whenever the view is changed, and provides a thumbnail list of all the objects of interest in the current view. The
more you zoom in, the shorter and shorter this list will become. For example, select 
<strong>Explore</strong> then <strong>Constellations</strong> then click on
<strong>Corvus</strong>. The context list is shown in the image below: </p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="115" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ContextSearch.jpg" width="1124"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are a lot of entries in the list, starting with the planet Saturn. 
This list does not only include the stellar objects in the constellation Corvus, 
but all those objects in the current view. They are sorted in order. The first 
items are the planets and named objects, the later ones often do not have a name 
other than their catalog entries - <em>NGC4024</em> for example. If this list is long, 
which it often is, use the previous and next arrows to scroll through it. Notice 
too that the context list is populated when a view comes to a halt, it is often 
empty when the view is animating from one location to the next. The size of the 
contexts lists can be reduced by de-selecting items in the <b><a href="#ContextSearch">Context Search</a> Filter</b>.</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="120" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ContextSearchFilter.jpg" width="230"></td><td>
	Only stars and supernova will now appear in the context list - no black 
	holes or neutron stars!</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The final elements of the lower panel are shown in the image below:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="129" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/LowerPanelFOV.jpg" width="314"></td>
<td>The small up and down arrows can be used to show and hide the lower panel itself. 
<br><br>The pane to the far right of the lower panel shows the <em>skyball</em> 
(displaying the field of view relative to the celestial sphere), and the 
selected constellation. This pane also shows the parameters of the view - the right ascension, declination and field of view in degrees (60:00:00 in 
this example). <br><br>You can drag the yellow rectangle around in the skyball to change the&nbsp;view. 
Click on the selected constellation to center the field of view on that 
constellation.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Right ascension and declination are a well known space co-ordinate system for astronomers, but to newcomers to astronomy
probably the best way to view them is as space longitude and latitude respectively. The field of view angle is at a maximum
of 60 degrees, which gives a wide angle view of the sky. Zooming in can narrow this to a tiny percentage of one degree.</p>

Earth also includes several overlays for clouds, elevation of geographic features, and 3D cities.</li>
<li>The <strong>Sky</strong> node applies to both <strong>Sky</strong> and <strong>3D Solar System</strong> views. Here you can toggle  overlays for constellation figures and boundaries, coordinate system grids, and planetary orbits. You can also select background imagery (such as the Milky Way) for the 3D Solar System view.</li>
<li>The <strong>Sandbox</strong> node lets you add custom content to view in <a href="#ExploreSandbox">Sandbox</a> mode.</li>
<li>The <strong>Dome</strong> node exposes options for using WorldWide Telescope with a planetarium dome.</li>

<p>There are several imagery options for the Earth, including aerial photography, streets, a hybrid of these two, and a night view. The night imagery is the simplest, yet it reveals information that the other views do not convey as well. In this tutorial we'll examine relative population density by comparing night and day images.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Look At</strong> list select <strong>Earth</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Imagery</strong> list scroll to the <strong>Bing Maps Streets</strong> view.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Settings</strong> pane ensure that <strong>Earth Cloud Layer Overlay</strong> is not selected.</li>
<li><p>Rotate the Earth using the mouse until southwest Australia is in view, then zoom in to the following location:
<img src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ex_Earth-OzDay.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Without changing the zoom or pan settings, change the <strong>Imagery</strong> to <strong>Earth at Night</strong>. Notice that the same
view angle is maintained even though the imagery has changed. Try toggling the <strong>Imagery</strong> to <strong>Bing Maps Streets</strong>, then back to <strong>Earth at Night</strong> again. Human population density is readily revealed with the glow of artificial light in the night view. The bright areas on the night map exactly matches the city of Perth named on the <strong>Bing Maps Streets</strong> view.

<h4><a name="TutorialLocatingOlympusMons">Tutorial: Locating Olympus Mons</a></h4>		

<p>Olympus Mons is the tallest mountain on Mars (and indeed the Solar System). At a colossal 17 miles high it is three times higher than Everest. The 
following tutorial locates the mountain:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b>Look At</b> list ensure that <b>Planet</b> has been selected.</li>
<li>In the <b>Imagery</b> list click on <b>Mars</b>.</li>
<li>Pan and rotate the view in order to locate the mountain, noting that it is 
close to the Martian equator. The mountain can be located visually either from
 its top-down view, which is distinctive, or from its proximity to three smaller mountains than are in
a near perfect line. These two views are shown in the following images:
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

	</table> </li>
<li>Zoom in and use the <b>CTRL</b> key as you click and drag vertically. This will tilt the view to show just how tall Olympus Mons actually is:

	</table></li>

<li>Olympus Mons is a <i>shield</i> volcano, approximately 340 miles wide. The most recent volcanic activity is 
estimated at 2 million years ago, so it is difficult to classify the volcano as extinct. One theory for the huge size
of the mountain is that Mars does not have tectonic plates, so there is no gradual crust movement to recycle the surface.&nbsp; 
However this theory is countered by the three mountains in a line, which 
suggests a plate edge. The three smaller mountains are also volcanoes and are 
named&nbsp; Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons&nbsp; and Ascraeus Mons, though they are 
smaller only in relation to Olympus Mons (Arsia Mons - the southernmost - is the 
tallest at about 12 miles high, Pavonis Mons - the middle of the three - the 
shortest at 8.6 miles, and Ascraeus Mons - the northernmost - is about 11 miles 
high).</li>
<li>Other surface features of Mars to look for include the great canyon, Valles 
Marineris, which runs along the equator and is over 2500 miles long. It is the 
deepest known crevice in the Solar System. Mars is also known for its plains, 
polar caps, and clear signs of water and wind erosion. Mars' surface temperature 
is quite cold, ranging from -140 to 20 Celsius. Its atmosphere is mostly carbon 
dioxide, but there is enough water vapor to form the occasional clouds.</li>

		only 8.6 light years, so Canopus would appear much brighter if it were 
		not so distant.<br><br></td></tr>

<li>Another interesting nearby star is Epsilon Eridani. At a distance of 10.5 
light years, and with an apparent magnitude of 3.73, it is often visible to the 
naked eye. Early observations of the star suggested, but did not confirm, that 
it is the nearest star with a planet - a gas giant similar to but larger than 
Jupiter - in a 7 Earth-year orbit. 
Search "Epsilon Eridani" to locate the star. Measurements 
using the Hubble Space Telescope have since confirmed the planet&#39;s existence. 
Planets are very difficult to detect because they are lost in the glare of their parent 
star. Their presence is usually inferred from a wobble in the star&#39;s 
movement (suggesting a nearby gravitational tug), or by coincidence when the 
planet crosses in front of the star from our viewpoint and alters the star&#39;s 
brightness to a degree. Because of these limitations in detection, most of the 
nearly 400 planets so far located are Jupiter-like in size. The nearest 
Earth-like planet so far detected orbits the red-dwarf star Gliese 581, located 
20 light years from Earth. Good images of planets are very hard to 
come by.</li>
<li>Visiting the nearest galaxy requires some definition. Large galaxies like the Milky Way have many smaller satellite galaxies, usually called dwarf
galaxies. The nearest known dwarf galaxy is Canis Major Dwarf, about 25,000 
light years distant from us. WorldWide Telescope does not yet have a single 
image of this galaxy, so we will visit instead the previous contender for the 
closest satellite galaxy, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, believed to be around 
70,000 light years from here. Change the <strong>Imagery</strong> selection from 
Hipparcos to the <a href="#DigitizedSkySurvey"><b>Digitized Sky Survey</b></a> and type "Sagittarius Dwarf" into the search text box.</li>

	</table>
<li>There are at least 10 other satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Some uncertainly exists over the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy and its sibling, the
Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy. Initial theories that these two were satellites of the Milky Way were revised when the speeds of the two galaxies was 
calculated to be far too high to be in orbit. Alternative theories include that these galaxies will pass by the Milky Way, or that they will not escape
the huge gravitational forces of the Milky Way, and will become satellites. Typing "Large" into the search text box is enough to bring up a 
range of thumbnails for the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy.

<li>The galaxy most often quoted as our nearest neighbor is the Andromeda galaxy. This behemoth of a galaxy contains an estimated one trillion stars, and
is so bright it is one of the furthest objects (at 2.5 Million light years) that can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Despite having many more stars than the Milky Way it is calculated
to have about the same mass, because of the greater amount of dark matter in the Milky Way. The two giant galaxies are set to collide in the distant 
future (the subject of a <a href="#GuidedTours">guided tour</a> in WorldWide Telescope). The Andromeda galaxy is also well known by its Messier Catalog name, M31. Type "M31" into the search text box.</li>

<li>The Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies are the two biggest galaxies in a group known as the Local Group. The Local Group has a third big galaxy,
Triangulum, and over twenty smaller galaxies, not including the many dwarf galaxies. The whole group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At about
3 million light years away, Triangulum is the furthest object that can be seen with the naked eye. It is sometimes referred to as the Pinwheel galaxy 
(though this name is also given to another galaxy, M101), but is most reliably 
located by its Messier Catalog number, M33. Note that you will get different search results for each of these three names, 
even though they can refer to the same object! This is because
the search is reliant on the names given to the objects by the creators of the images.</li>

<li>An object in the sky can usually be located by searching on its name, or one of its names, but you can also enter its stellar co-ordinates (known as right
ascension or RA, and declination, or Dec). These co-ordinates are similar to longitude and latitude on Earth, though right ascension is often given in hours, minutes and seconds (it can also be given in degrees). Declination is almost always in degrees. The RA and Dec of Triangulum are
RA: 1 hour 33 minutes 50 seconds, and Dec: 30 degrees 39 minutes 36 seconds. Enter these simply as <code>1 33 50</code>, and <code>30 39 36</code> into the RA and Dec boxes in the search panel. Click <b>Go</b> to navigate to the location.

<li>All of the galaxies visited so far are part of the Local Group, which makes up a small part of the Virgo Supercluster. This supercluster contains
at least 100 galaxy groups, and has a diameter of around 110 million light years. There are millions of superclusters in the known Universe. The
Local Group is an outlying group within the Virgo Supercluster. The Virgo Cluster forms the heart of the supercluster, and contains up to 2000 galaxies.

<li>The nearest supercluster to the Virgo Supercluster is the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster. It is one of the estimated 10 million superclusters in the

concepts called <em>walls </em>or <em>sheets</em>, which can be a billion light years in length. 
Other theories have the superclusters moving in <em>rivers</em> towards objects 
with massive gravitational pull. However, a visit to the Virgo Cluster completes

<p>This tutorial shows how to use WorldWide Telescope to plan an evening's astronomical observing. In the first set of steps, you'll learn how to set your location, and track the sun to determine the ideal time to begin viewing. Complete the tutorial by following the steps to help locate common objects in either the <a href="#NorthernHemisphere">Northern  Hemisphere</a>, or <a href="#SouthernHemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To Set Location and Determine Optimal Viewing Time</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that the <strong>Look at</strong> box has been set to <strong>Sky</strong>, and that the <strong>Imagery</strong> is set to <strong>Digitized Sky Survey</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>View</strong> panel, set the <strong>Observing Location</strong> and <strong>Observing time</strong> to match your viewing location (Windows Client only; the Web Client will automatically use your present location).</li>
<li>Check the <strong>View from this location</strong> checkbox.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Search</strong> and enter <strong>Sun</strong>. Click on the thumbnail for the Sun to track it. Right click on the Sun to bring up    and track the <a href="#TheFinderScope">The Finder Scope</a>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>View</strong> to bring back the view panel, and fast forward the observing time    (usually <strong>x1000</strong> works well) while tracking the Sun. Faint stars and galaxies are best seen once the Sun is at least 18 degrees below the horizon. Pause the <strong>Observing time</strong> when the Sun's <strong>Alt</strong> is close to <code style="font-family: Consolas;">-18:00:00</code>. Use reverse time if you overshoot! Now write down the <strong>Observing Time</strong> shown in the <strong>View</strong> panel.</li>
<li>The sky now displayed by WorldWide Telescope is ready to be viewed. Keep your notebook handy to jot down the altitude and azimuth of any object that might be visible.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Search</strong> to bring up the search options again, type <strong>Solar System</strong>, but this time click the checkbox <strong>Plot Results</strong>. Now pan and zoom around the sky to see if any planets will be in view. The best time to observe a planet, neglecting weather conditions, is close to    its transit time (when it is at its highest point in the sky).</li>

<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

<li>The plotted results for the Solar System will include our own moon. It is a beautiful object to look at and it can be so bright it dominates the night sky. Click the Moon's thumbnail in the search results panel. Now you can see whether the Moon will be above or below the horizon, what phase it will be in, and what other objects it will be near.</li>
<li>Outside of the Solar System, look for constellations and <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/asterism">asterisms</a>.</li>

<li>Look to the north to find the Big Dipper, stars part of the constellation Ursa Major. The ladle of the dipper has two stars that can be used to point to Polaris, the north star. Polaris is very close to the Earth's rotational axis, so it will be in the northern sky at an elevation equal to an observer's latitude all day and night. Polaris is a <em>Cepheid variable star</em>, a star with a pulsating outer atmosphere, making it slightly brighter and then dimmer depending mostly on its changing surface area.</li>

<li>If it is winter in the northern hemisphere, Orion the great hunter will be climbing through the sky. Easily identifiable by his belt, the surrounding constellations are also interesting. To the west, find Taurus the bull with a red giant eye, Aldeberan. This star is just like the northeastern star of Orion, Betelgeuse. A star further along in its evolution than the Sun, Betelgeuse is no longer fusing hydrogen in its core, but is fusing helium. Hydrogen is still being fused to produce energy, but only in a shell surrounding the core. This is not a very stable method of holding a star up and consequently red giant stars often pulsate trying to establish a steady equilibrium between gravity pulling material inward while the force from photons created in the interior push outward.</li>
<li>The triangle of stars shown below is sometimes called the winter triangle: (clockwise from upper left) Procyon, Betelgeuse, and Siris. Sirius is part of Canis Major, the larger of Orion's hunting dogs. It's a bright massive star that happens to be relatively close to us, and it's the closest star you can see at night in the northern hemisphere. The bright star south of Sirius in Canis Major, named Wezen, is in contrast one of the most distant stars you can see without a telescope (at 1614 light years away). Sirius and Procyon are both the brighter members of a binary system - they are both in orbit with a white dwarf star, the collapsed core of a star that was once about the size of our Sun.</li>

<li>In the summer, three bright stars make up the summer triangle. Counterclockwise from the left, Deneb, Vega, and Altair. Deneb is an amazing star, a blue super giant that appears bright in our skies even though it is over 1400 light years away. It is the tail of Cygnus the swan. Vega is one of the brightest stars in our night sky and is part of the constellation Lyra, a harp. Arab astronomers had Vega being part of a constellation that was a vulture, making the summer triangle three birds. Altair is part of the constellation Aguilla, the Eagle. These three stars straddle the background Milky Way, the disk of our galaxy. The white cloudy appearance is actually due to many stars and nebulae so distant we can't separate them. You have to be far from a city to see the Milky Way.</li>

<ol>
<li>If you are in the Southern hemisphere, there is an equally great variety    of objects to look for. The two galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud, may be in view. These galaxies may be satellites of the Milky Way - or may just be passing through - or may even be attempting    to pass by but in fact will become satellites. As big as the Large Magellanic Cloud is, it is about one tenth the mass of the Milky Way. These galaxies are fairly close to the bright star Canopus.</li>

<li>Of special interest are the closest stars to Earth (at 4.3 light years),    the binary system of Alpha Centauri, which might be visible in the    constellation Centaurus. To locate it search on its alternative name: Rigil    Kentaurus.</li>
<li>One of the best known formations in the southern skies is the Southern Cross. Use the search options to locate any one of its four stars: Acrux,    Becrux, Gacrux or Decrux. Alternatively select <strong>Explore</strong>,    then <strong>Constellations</strong>, then click on the <strong>Crux</strong>    thumbnail.</li>

<li>The globular cluster Omega Centauri contains millions of stars, many as    close as 0.1 light years to each other, and may be the remains of a small galaxy that collided with the Milky Way. It is about 15800 light years from    Earth, and appears as a single point of light to us. There is evidence of a    black hole at its center. Search for it using its catalog name, NGC5139.</li>

<h4><a name="TutorialAstronomyTutorial">Tutorial: Astronomy Terminology</a></h4>	

<p>In this tutorial WorldWide Telescope is used to demonstrate the purpose behind some of the most commonly used terms in astronomy.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set the <strong>Look at</strong> box to <strong>Sky</strong>,and the <strong>Imagery</strong> to <strong>Digitized Sky Survey</strong>. Also ensure <strong>View from this location</strong> is not selected in the <strong>View</strong> pane.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Objects in the sky are located using <em>right ascension</em> (RA) and <em>declination</em> (Dec). Right ascension in space is equivalent to longitude on the Earth. Longitude is an east-west bearing from the Greenwich Meridian, right ascension is the east-west bearing from an equally arbitrary point in space - the point where the Sun crosses the <em>celestial equator</em> on the March <em>equinox</em>. The equinox is chosen because at this point the Earth is neither tilted towards or away from the Sun, but instead is vertically aligned with the Sun (the <em>solstices</em> occur when the tilt is at a maximum). The celestial equator is none other than the Earth's equator projected out into space, and the north and south <em>celestial poles</em> are simply our own poles projected out indefinitely. Where the Sun crosses the celestial equator both right ascension and declination are zero.</p>
<p> Declination is similar to latitude on Earth, measuring a north-south bearing. Objects above the celestial equator have a positive declination, objects below it a negative declination. The point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator is known as <em>The First Point of Aries</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Layer Manager under <strong>Sky &gt; Overlays &gt; Constellations</strong>, uncheck the boxes for <strong>Constellation Figures</strong> and <strong>Constellation Boundaries</strong>. Then, under <strong>Sky &gt; Overlays &gt; Grids</strong>, check the boxes for <strong>Equatorial Grid</strong> and <strong>Ecliptic Grid</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the <strong>Search</strong> panel, enter <code style="font-family: Consolas;">0</code> for <strong>RA</strong> and <code style="font-family: Consolas;">0</code> for <strong>Dec</strong>, then click <strong>Go</strong>.</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="375" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/firstpointofaries.jpg" width="767"><br>
		The track of the Sun across the sky is known as the <strong><em>ecliptic</em></strong>. 
		The First Point of Aries should now be in the middle of your view. </td></tr>
	</table>

</li>
<li><p>The right ascension and declination of celestial objects do not change, unless the position of the objects changes relative to the coordinate system which of course they do, but very slowly, so slowly that it is only necessary to revise the coordinate system every 50 years. Each time a coordinate system is fixed, it is called an <em>epoch</em>. The current epoch, and the only one supported in WorldWide Telescope, is the <strong>J2000</strong> epoch - namely the position of the celestial objects and coordinate system at Noon on January 1st in the year 2000, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England. The change to the J2000 epoch was made in 1984, as the positions of stars can be predicted accurately in advance of the actual year. There may of course be a change to the J2050 epoch, perhaps sometime after the year 2025.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Of course stars and all other objects do appear to move in the sky, as a    result of the rotation and orbit of the Earth. At any one moment the position of an object in the sky can be referenced by its <em>azimuth</em> and <em>altitude</em>. Azimuth is    similar to longitude or right ascension, in that it is an east-west bearing    from true north. Altitude is an angle rather than a distance, it is the    angle up or down from the horizon. By convention positive azimuth is to the east, negative to the west, and positive altitude is up from the horizon. Unlike right ascension and declination, azimuth and altitude change continuously. For example, open the <strong>Search</strong> panel, then enter <strong>Sirius</strong> in the search text box. When the bright star Sirius appears, zoom away from it until the view is from Earth (that is, minimize the zoom completely). Right-click on Sirius in the sky to bring up the <a href="#TheFinderScope">Finder Scope</a>.</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="430" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/azimuthaltitude.jpg" width="413"></td><td>
		<p>Note that the seconds values for the Altitude (<strong>Alt</strong>) and Azimuth (<strong>Az</strong>) 
		of Sirius are changing, even when you look at the star in real time.</p>
        <p>In the <strong>View &gt; Observing Time</strong> pane click the accelerated time button (the one with the "fast-forward" icon). The altitude and azimuth will now change quite quickly.</p>
<p> Altitude and azimuth are very useful values when aligning a physical telescope from Earth to locate a particular star or planet. The values are different for every view point on Earth, hence the usefulness of right ascension and declination as a fixed coordinate system.</p>
    </td></tr>

</li>

<li><p>The <strong>Magnitude</strong> entry on the <strong>Finder Scope</strong> refers to the <em>apparent magnitude</em> of the brightness of Sirius. For a description of what this means refer to the <a href="#StellarBrightness">Stellar Brightness</a> section, or work through the <a href="#TutorialVisitingtheNeighbors">Tutorial: Visiting the Neighbors</a> tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Distance</strong> entry on the <strong>Finder Scope</strong> is the distance to the object in <em>light years</em>. A light year is an enormous distance. The speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282.397 miles per second (a <em>light second</em>), which works out to just under six trillion miles per year, approximately 5,878,500,000,000 (186.282.397 x 60 x 60x 24 x 365.2424) miles. The Sun is about 500 light seconds from Earth, the next nearest star is 4.2 light years away, or over 24 trillion miles. Occasionally space telescopes pick up events that help us visualize how sizeable a light year is in relation to the cosmos. For example, click <strong>Explore</strong>, then  <strong>Hubble Studies</strong>, then click <strong>Supernova1987A</strong> .This will bring up a range of seven thumbnails. Click on the fifth, <strong>Supernova1987A - 28th November 2003</strong>. Now click on the sixth thumbnail, <strong>Supernova1987A - 12th December 2004</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The light year is the most common unit of measurement in astronomy, but not the only one. Open the <strong>Search</strong> panel, then enter <strong>Neptune</strong> into the search text box. Click the thumbnail to show the planet, then right-click on the planet image itself to bring up the <strong>Finder Scope</strong>. For    <strong>Distance</strong>, note that it is set at 29 <em>au</em> (astronomical units). One astronomical unit is the mean distance from the    Earth to the Sun. This unit of measurement is much smaller than a light    year, and is useful within solar systems. The distance of 29 au to Neptune is the distance    from Earth to Neptune at a specific point in time, the measurement will    slowly vary as the planets orbit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The three values below <strong>Distance</strong> in the <strong>Finder    Scope</strong> are <em>Rise</em>, <em>Transit</em>    and <em>Set</em>. Due to the Earth's rotation almost all visible celestial objects will appear to rise in the east and set in the west. By    far the most important rise and set times are obviously those of the Sun. Because stars can only be seen at night their rising and setting may be invisible to us, however they follow the same pattern. The transit time is the time the object crosses the meridian of the observer, so in most cases    will be the highest point of the object in the sky. Transit times can become problematic if the observer is near the poles, where a celestial object can appear to pass overhead several times. In order to see an object at its clearest, Earth observers will often try to time the observation to match the transit time. Rise, transit and set times are different for every viewing location on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>View</strong> panel select the <strong>Observing Location</strong> (New York in the example below),    and check <strong>View from this location</strong>. This will ensure we have    a horizon line (rising and setting are obviously meaningless without one). Next, in the <strong>Search</strong> panel text box, enter <strong>Moon</strong>. Click on the thumbnail for a close-up view of the moon, then zoom out till the horizon line is in view. Next, bring up the <strong>View</strong> panel again, and in the <strong>Observing Time</strong> pane, accelerate the time to <strong>x1000</strong>. You will notice the moon rise and set fairly rapidly. By carefully pausing or    slowing the simulated time down, you should be able to match the rising and    setting times with those on the <strong>Finder Scope.</strong></p>

<li><p>Occasionally, instead of rise, transit and set times you will see the word <em>Circumpolar</em>. This means that the object will not go below the horizon, and so will not rise or set but will be in view all of the time. This happens when the object is near one of the celestial poles. For example, go to <strong>Observing Location</strong>, and instead of selecting a city simply enter some extreme coordinates (for example Latitude 80 degrees, Longitude 0 degrees as shown in the image below). Then search for and locate the Sun. Depending on the time of year and location, the Sun can become circumpolar, as in the example.</p>
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

		to show that the Sun does not dip below the horizon, but instead casts 
		an ellipse in the sky.</td></tr>
	</table>

</li>
<li><p>For a near perfect example of circumpolar activity select a northerly location, use the search options to find Polaris, then zoom out. Next, accelerate the simulated time rapidly. Note that the star remains almost stationary in the sky as everything else rotates. Similarly for the southern skies, select a southern city, search for Polaris Australis, and again watch as it stays almost stationary in the sky. These two stars are examples of <em>pole stars</em>. Although Polaris is often referred to as <em>the</em> pole star, it is in fact just one of many, which change over time, that hardly move in the sky and act as great aids to navigation. The main reason why pole stars change over time is due to the Earth's <em>precession</em>. Precession is the gradual shift in an object's rotational axis or orbit. Earth's precession is induced by the gravity of the other planets, causing the Earth to wobble on its axis cyclically over a period of 26000 years. It is because of precession that the epochs mentioned earlier, such the current J2000,are required. It is also because of precession that the First Point of Aries, mentioned in step 2 of this tutorial, is currently in Pisces. When the equinoxes were first recognized thousands of years ago, this point did lie in Aries! In about the year 2600 it will cross into Aquarius.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The J2000, also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, uses right ascension, declination, and the J2000 epoch. You will find the J2000 coordinate system to be the most useful, but there are also other coordinate systems. In the <strong>Search</strong> panel there are options for <strong>J2000</strong>, <strong>Azimuth and Altitude</strong>, <strong>Ecliptic</strong> and <strong>Galactic</strong> coordinate systems. The Ecliptic coordinate system uses the Sun's ecliptic circle as the celestial equator, rather than a projection of the Earth's equator. Try changing the coordinate system from <strong>J2000</strong> to <strong>Galactic</strong>. The galactic coordinate system is based on a line from the Sun to the center of the Milky Way, with a celestial equator in line with the galactic plane. The Sun rotates about the center of the Milky Way at a speed of about 220 kilometers per second in an imperfect circle, and one rotation is called a <strong>galactic year</strong>. It takes around 230 million Earth years to complete one galactic year. Now enter zero for both lambda (λ) and beta (β), then click <strong>Go</strong>. You should now be looking at the center of the Milky Way.</p>

<h4><a name="TutorialComparingStylesofPanorama">Tutorial: Comparing Styles of Panorama</a></h4>	

<p>There is much less expanse to explore in panoramas than in the other viewing options. In most cases rotating the view will
cover most of the content fairly quickly. The following tutorial simply goes through a number of the different panoramas,
showing different presentation styles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that <b>Panorama</b> is selected in the <b>Look At</b> list.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Imagery</strong> list select <strong>Pathfinder: Many Rovers</strong>. As only one Rover was present on this mission to Mars it is clear this is a composite of many individual images. If you scroll down you can see the airbags that were used to cushion the probe's landing. This was required because of the rock strewn landscape. The rover, named <em>Sojourner</em>, is only 25 inches long.
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="340" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Panorama_ManyRovers.jpg" width="600"></td></tr>
	</table></li>
<li>Taking panoramic photographs is one of the objectives of unmanned missions. However, discerning detail from a 
camera at a low elevation and at a fixed point can be problematic. One method of addressing this is to increase the 
contrast by coloring the image. In the <b>Imagery</b> list scroll down to 
<b>Opportunity: Endurance South (false color)</b>. Compare this with the <b>Opportunity: Endurance South</b> panorama, 
which lacks added color, to understand why researchers color images. Notice how the false color image makes certain details much more visible!
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="340" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Panorama_FalseColor.jpg" width="600"></td></tr>
	</table></li>
<li>To see another method of highlighting landscape, scroll in the <b>Imagery</b> list to <b>Opportunity: Lyell</b>. Rotate
the view until the large crater is in view, shown in the following image:	
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

		<img alt="" height="330" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Panorama_Lyell.jpg" width="600"></td></tr>
	</table></li>
<li>Now load the <b>Opportunity: Lyell (stereo)</b> imagery, and using a pair of red and cyan glasses, pan to the same
location in the stereo view. The escarpment certainly stands out!</li>
<li>Even though the exploratory spacecraft were equipped with panoramic cameras, most panoramas have dark
zones where no images were taken. Typically these dark zones are looking 
straight up and straight down, though some panoramas are only 
partial. Try <b>Opportunity: Burns Cliff</b>, shown below. for example. <br><br>Note that if you load a panorama and see only black background,
rotate the view as the panorama may only be partial.

<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun, as seen from some locations on Earth. The result
is a spectacular mid-day darkness along a path across the Earth. To view the effect in WorldWide Telescope, go through
the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Research a time and location of a total solar eclipse. 
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat/SEdecade2041.html">NASA</a> maintains a 
website dedicated to this task, as do many other astronomy websites. For 
example, in the year 2041 April 30th, starting around 12.00 UTC (Universal time, or Greenwich Mean
Time) there will be a total eclipse tracking across Africa and passing close to Lake Victoria.</li>
<li>Select <b>SolarSystem</b> for the <b>Look At</b> list.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the <strong>Planet Size</strong> slider is set to
	<strong>Actual</strong>. The geometry will be incorrect if this is not set 
	correctly.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Earth</b> thumbnail that appears in the lower panel.</li>
	<li>In Layer Manager, check <strong>Sky &gt; 3d Solar System &gt; Multi-res Solar System Bodies</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>View</strong> panel ensure that the <strong>Lighting</strong> 
	item is checked.</li>
	<li>Also in the <b>View</b> panel change the <b>Observing Time</b> date information to the correct date: 
	<strong>Year </strong>2041 <strong>Month </strong>4 <strong>Day </strong>30,
as one example.</li>
	<li>Also in the <b>Observing Time</b> panel, select <b>UTC</b>, then 
	set the&nbsp;time to <strong>Hrs 
	</strong> 12<strong> Min </strong> 0<strong> Sec </strong>0.
Click <b>Apply</b>. Close or unpin the <b>Date Time Selection</b> panel.</li>
	<li>Now rotate the Earth with the mouse until central Africa is in view. Zoom in a little to see the shadow of
the Moon more clearly.</li>
	<li>Carefully use the fast forward button (setting it to <strong>x100</strong>) in the <b>Observing Time</b> 
	panel to view the shadow as it moves across the continent. It should look 
	similar to the following image as it passes Lake Victoria (at a time of 
	12.52.05 UTC):

	</li>
</ol>

<p>To see the same eclipse but in the <strong>Sky</strong> view use the following 
procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Sky</strong> in the <strong>Look At </strong>list.</li>
<li>In the <b>View</b> panel, select <b>Observing Location &gt; Setup</b> and select the city 
<strong>Kampala, Uganda</strong>.</li>
<li>In Layer Manager, under <b>Sky &gt; Overlays &gt; Grids</b>, check the <b>Ecliptic Grid</b> setting.</li>
<li>In the <b>View</b> panel select <b>Observing Time</b>, and set the date to 2041, April 30th. Set the time to 11.30 UTC.</li>
<li>Select <b>Explore &gt; Constellations</b> and click on <b>Aries</b>. It is in this constellation that the eclipse occurs.</li>
<li>Zoom in a little to view the Sun and Moon a bit more closely.</li>
<li>Accelerate the time to <strong>x100</strong> to view the eclipse. You may have to pan the screen a bit to keep the eclipse in view.

<h2><a name="GuidedTours">Guided Tours</a></h2>


<p>Guided Tours are annotated and animated slide-shows, created to demonstrate a feature of WorldWide Telescope (such as the
<strong>Welcome</strong> tour), galaxies (such as the <strong>Sombrero Galaxy</strong> tour), or different views and perspectives of the sky and Earth (such as 
the <strong>Multiple Worlds</strong> tour). Feel free at any time to pause a 
tour, explore on your own (with multiple information sources for objects at your 
fingertips), and rejoin the tour where you left off. </p>
<p>Highly rated tours include <strong>Tours &gt; Galaxies &gt; Universal Beauty</strong> 
-- a tour of spectacular sights in the Universe set to music, created by High 
Skies. For a clear explanation of the search for Earth type planets, visit
<strong>Tours &gt; Planets &gt; Search for Extra Solar Planets</strong>, created by the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Or select<strong> Tours &gt; Galaxies &gt; Dust &amp; Us</strong> to 
join Harvard Astronomer Alyssa Goodman on a journey showing how dust in the 
Milky Way Galaxy condenses into stars and planets. Select <strong>Tours &gt; Cosmology &gt; Dark Matter at Abell 1689</strong> to take a tour with University of 
Chicago Cosmologist Mike Gladders to see a 
gravitational lens bending the light from galaxies allowing you to see billions 
of years into the past. Looking to the future, our own Milky Way galaxy is expected to collide with the 
Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years time, which is explained in the <strong>
Tours &gt; Galaxies &gt; Impact with M31</strong> tour, created by Francis Reddy of 
Astronomy Magazine. The apparent result of a galactic collision is shown in the

<p>Adding slides to your tour could hardly be easier. Simply navigate to where you want to be and click <b>Add a Slide</b>.
Note that when you do this a thumbnail image of the current view is taken, and added to your tour. 
You can change the view using the <strong>Look At</strong> and <strong>Imagery</strong> 
lists between slides though if you do the tour will jump sharply from one image 
to the next and not scroll smoothly.</p>
<p>The key editing elements are to the right of the image above. <strong>Tour 
Properties</strong> will bring up the original properties dialog, for editing. 
<strong>Music</strong>, <strong>Voiceover</strong>, <strong>Text</strong>, 
<strong>Shapes</strong> and <strong>Picture</strong> items can be added to the slide. The
<strong>Show Safe Area</strong> checkbox can be used if you are using a wide 
screen, but plan on the tour being fully visible to users of narrower screens - 
checking it simply shades out the wider area.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Music</b>: MP3 and WMA files are the supported formats for both music and 
voice. Browse for a suitable piece. Note that there are not fade-in, fade-out or 
other sound effects available in WorldWide Telescope, so applying effects must be 
done independently in audio editing software. Only volume can be adjusted while 
editing a tour. If a piece of music is attached to 
an individual slide, and the piece 
is longer than the slide display time, the music will cut off suddenly at the 
end of the 
slide. The recommended approach is to attach music to the starting <a href="#MasterSlides">Master Slide</a>, 
so that the music
runs without glitches throughout the tour. Start by completing a silent version 
of the tour, so you know exactly how long the tour is, then locate suitable music and 
apply fading and perhaps other 
effects (using quality music editing software) and finally apply it to the 
tour when the music and tour are in a completed state.&nbsp; Note that the entire music file is embedded in the tour binary, so it is a good idea to fade out and
truncate the music at exactly the right time, so as not to store unnecessary data.</li>
<li><b>Voiceover</b>: Use a similar procedure as for music, recording and 
editing the audio using quality software. The Sound Recorder accessory provided with Windows can be used to create voiceovers if you 
have a microphone attached to your computer, but without any editing features it 
is of limited utility. The difference between voiceovers and music is that 
voiceovers <em>should</em> be applied to each individual slide, to get the 
timing right. Both music and voice can be rendered simultaneously, 
though adjust the volumes appropriately.</li>
<li><b>Text</b>: 
Enter the text into the dialog, along with font and color information. Note that 
the text can be resized on the slide, so there is no need to get the point size 
perfect within this dialog. 
If a background color is required for the text, select one after clicking on the 
palette icon in the text dialog. Add line breaks by pressing ENTER where 
required.<br><br>Click <strong>Save</strong> to add the 
text to the slide. Then use the resize and rotate handles as necessary. 
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

on any of the white space around the color picker. The two colored boxes at the 
	bottom of the color picker show the old and new colors respectively.</td></tr>
</table>

</li>
<li><b>Shapes</b>: 

Circles, rectangles, open rectangles, rings, lines, arrows and stars are 
supported shapes. Once added to the screen, edit some of their properties using 
the right click menu shown below. 

<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>

	Use the <strong>Bring to...</strong> and <strong>Send...</strong> 
	options to layer multiple images appropriately.<br><br>
	
	Selecting the <strong>Color/Opacity </strong>entry will bring up the color 
	picker dialog 
	shown above.<br><br>
	
	Selecting <strong>Hyperlink</strong> will add a URL to 
	the tour. If the user clicks on the shape, the URL will be opened in the 
	default browser in a separate window. Note that no indication that this is a 
	link is provided automatically -- this indication should be provided by the 
	tour author.<br><br>
	
	<strong>Animate </strong>enables the movement, recoloring and resizing of text, shapes or pictures. To animate an
	object, first move it, size it and color it at the location in the view you wish it to start. Then click
	<b>Animate</b>. Then drag the object to the location you wish the animation to end, and 
	recolor and resize the object if
	required. Then deselect the object. Animations are only enabled between a starting point and an ending point.
	Right-click the slide you are working on, select <b>Preview Tour From Here...</b> and test the animations. Each
	animated object should smoothly move, recolor and resize over the time period assigned to the slide.</td></tr>
</table>

</li>
<li><b>Picture</b>: Jpeg, Tiff, Png and <a href="#FITSImages">FITS</a> still images can be added to the 
slide. Similar to text and shape entries, picture entries can be resized and 
rotated on the slide. The same right click menu available for <strong>Shapes</strong> 
can be used with pictures.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Slide Editing Menu</h4>
<p>Some editing options are not quite so visible. Right click on a slide to 
bring up a menu with a range of detailed options:</p>

	smoothly animate from the starting to ending positions.<br><br>Use <strong>
	Capture New Thumbnail</strong> to replace the thumbnail image of a selected 
	slide.<br><br>To add a slide for a particular time -- say to capture an 
	eclipse or a crescent moon or a certain alignment of a star or planet, for example -- go through the following 
	procedure:<br>
	<ol>
	<li>Click <b>View</b> then open the <strong>Date Time Selection</strong> pane from the 
	<strong>Observing Time </strong>pane.</li>
	<li>Click the push-pin icon in the <strong>Date Time Selection</strong> pane 
	to undock it.</li>
	<li>Use the arrows to select the required time. Click <strong>Apply</strong> 
	as many times as necessary to locate the exact time you want. Do not click 
	<strong>OK</strong> so the <strong>Date Time Selection </strong>pane remains open. 
	So far you have not edited the tour, but just selected the right data and 
	time.</li>
	<li>Click the tour title bar to return to editing the tour. Create the new 
	slide if it does not already exist and ensure the slide that the date 
	and time applies to
	is highlighted with a yellow outline. Right-click to bring up the editing 
	context menu, and ensure 
	<strong>Track Date/Time/Location</strong> is selected.</li>
	<li>Right-click the slide again to bring up the menu again, and this time select <strong>Set Camera Start Position</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Date Time Selection</strong> pane (that should still be 
	storing the required date and time for the camera), click 
	<strong>OK</strong>. This edits the tour and applies the date and time to 
	the slide.</li>
			<li>Preview your tour to ensure you have done this procedure 
			correctly.</li>

	</ol></td></tr>
</table>
<p>By default each slide will appear for 10.0 seconds. To change this click on the 
pane just below each slide, and use the up and down arrows to change the number 
of seconds. </p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

	transition times from one slide to another are included in the total run 
	time.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="MasterSlides">Master Slides</a></h4>
<p>Before progressing to add more and more slides, first consider creating a master slide. Master 
slides are templates that are applied to all subsequent slides, containing 
watermarks, logos, copyright messages, and so on. One tour can 
have one or more master slides -- so the master slide can change as the tour 
progresses, though only the most recent master slide applies to any one slide in a 
tour. All music, voiceovers, text, shapes and pictures on a master slide will be applied to all 
subsequent slides. </p>
<p>If background music is to be applied to your tour, consider starting the tour 
with a master slide with a display time of only a second or two, and attaching 
the music file to this one slide.</p>
<p>To make a slide a master slide, right click to bring up the context menu, 
then select <strong>Master Slide</strong>. A bold <strong>M</strong> will appear 
on the thumbnail. To revert a slide to normal status, bring up the menu and 
click <strong>Master Slide</strong> again.</p>

<h4>Slide Title</h4>
<p>To add a title to a slide, click on the area below the thumbnail but inside the yellow bounding rectangle, and type up
to 15 characters as a title, for example:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="93" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Tours_New_SlideTitle.jpg" width="114"></td><td>
	Note that a selected slide can be dragged and dropped to a new location in 
	the displayed list of slides.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Control Views and Settings</h4>
<p>To change current view settings for your slides, go into the <strong>View</strong> 
or <strong>Settings</strong> menus and make the appropriate changes for the 
selected slide (for example, to turn Constellation Figures or Boundary lines on 
or off). To go back to editing the tour, click on the name of the tour in the 
menu bar. </p>
<p><strong>View</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong> entries can be changed 
for each slide.</p>

<h4>Completing the Tour</h4>
<p>Click <b>Save</b> in the tour editing pane to save off the tour at any stage. Close the tour when it is completed by
clicking the <strong>X </strong>by the name in the menu bar:</p>

<h4><a name="SharingtheTour">Sharing the Tour</a></h4>
<p>Tours can be sent by email to friends and colleagues. A tour is stored in a .wtt 
file, and can be sent as an attachment to a normal email. The file size of the 
tour should obviously be below the limit applied by your ISP.</p>
<p>Well produced and interesting tours could also be submitted to a community 
you are a member of, or for consideration by Microsoft Research for inclusion in WorldWide Telescope 
itself. </p>

<h3><a name="CreatinganInteractiveTour">Creating an Interactive Tour</a></h3>
<p>
</p>

<p>An interactive tour is a tour where the user is required to give feedback. 
This feedback could be in response to a menu of possible selections, such as in 
a quiz with multiple choice answers, or even as simple as &quot;where do you want to 
go from here?&quot;. The main difference between an interactive tour and a normal 
tour is that an interactive tour will not follow a set sequence of events, but 
will instead jump from one stop on the tour to another that has been selected by 
the user, or is in response to input from the user.</p>
<p>The basic process for creating an interactive tour is very similar to that of 
creating any other tour, this section just covers the differences. So if you are 
not familiar with the process of creating a tour, start with the <a href="#CreatingaTour">Creating a Tour</a> section.</p>
<p>Scenarios for interactive tours include providing &quot;Back&quot; buttons in normal 
tours, creating coursework quizzes - perhaps at the end of a normal tour, the 
students can be quizzed on its contents, and in providing some control over the 
flow of a complex or long tour.</p>
<h4>Tour Menu Selection</h4>
<p>The following images shows a typical menu system that might appear in a quiz. 
The blue text entries are all links to other slides. The white text entries are not 
linked to other slides.</p>
<table class="T2" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="423" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/InteractiveTourMenu.jpg" width="606"><br>
	The question (or menu) slide.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="364" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/InteractiveTourWrong.jpg" width="302"><br>
		Three text entries in the question slide are linked to the &quot;Wrong&quot; 
		answer slide: Mars, Mercury and Pluto.<br><br>The &quot;Try again&quot; text will 
		return the user to the question slide.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
		<img alt="" height="332" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/InteractiveTourCorrect.jpg" width="280"><br>
		Only the correct text entry on the question slide is linked to the 
		&quot;Correct&quot; answer slide: Venus.<br><br>The &quot;This is Venus&quot; text will more 
		the user onto the next question.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In order to create the menu system shown above, <em>first</em> create all the 
required slides with the appropriate text on them. Next right click on each text 
entry in turn, and click on <strong>Link to Slide</strong>, this will bring up the 
following dialog:</p>
<table class="T2" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="260" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/InteractiveTourSelectLink.jpg" width="612"><br>
	Slides can be linked to another specific slide with the <b>Link to Slide (Select below)</b>&nbsp; 
	option. This is the appropriate selection for all the menu entries - linking 
	&quot;Venus&quot; to the correct slide, and the rest to the &quot;Wrong&quot; slide.<br><br>The 
	&quot;Wrong&quot; slide may be used many times, so its &quot;Try again&quot; text should be 
	linked to <b>Return to Caller</b> - so the user will be returned to the 
	question they got wrong.<br><br>The correct answer slide will probably be 
	linked to the next question with the normal <b>Link to Next Slide</b> option.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Any of the overlays - text, shapes or pictures - can be turned into active links. There are a few things to consider when creating an
interactive rather than normal tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master slides apply to the slides that follow it in linear order, not necessarily the order that the slides will be displayed. Consider making
every slide that links to, or from, a slide out of normal sequence a master slide.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the timeout of a menu slide (or any slide with links on it that a user should select one of) from simply moving on to the next slide,
 link that slide to itself. For example, the menu and "Wrong" slides should link back to themselves, however the "Correct" slide can simply timeout and
 move on to the next question slide.</li>
 <li>Music will not necessarily be rendered smoothly when the user jumps around the slides.</li>
	<li>Links can be applied to entire slides, rather than to overlay entries. 
	For example, instead of the &quot;Wrong&quot; slide having a &quot;Try again&quot; button the 
	slide could be linked with <b>Return to Caller</b>, in which case 
	it would simply timeout and then return the user to the question slide. Or 
	of course, both systems could be used.</li>

<h2><a name="TheTelescopeMenu">The Telescope Menu</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to control and track a physical telescope connected directly 
to your computer with a USB cable. With everything working correctly it is 
possible to both move the view of the physical telescope and have WorldWide 
Telescope mimic the movements and display the virtual view, or to change the 
view within WorldWide Telescope and have the physical telescope&#39;s motor drive 
change its position and display the actual view. In order to do this the 
physical telescope must work with the ASCOM Platform software.</p>
<p>Note that there are some practical considerations to setting up this system. 
The physical telescope obviously needs to have a good view of the sky, which for 
most users means an outside location, and at the same time the computer needs 
internet access for WorldWide Telescope to function, and both systems need 
electrical power. Also note that most telescopes are not digital, the electric 
power is only controlling the movement of the hub, the actual view from the 
physical telescope is not stored digitally and cannot be transferred to the 
computer.</p>

<p>The first step in controlling a physical telescope is to install the ASCOM software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <b>Telescope</b> to open up the telescope panel. Note the ASCOM logo to the far right of the panel, with the
words <b>Not Installed</b> underneath it.<br>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="110" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMNotInstalled.jpg" width="187"></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>Click on the ASCOM logo to follow a link to the <strong>ASCOM Standards for Astronomy</strong> page, and download the ASCOM Platform:
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="134" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMDownload.jpg" width="247"></td></tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>Go through the download and installation procedures. This may take a few minutes.</li>
<li>Confirm that the software has been installed by ensuring the word <b>Installed</b> now appears below the ASCOM logo in
WorldWide Telescope. Close and restart WorldWide Telescope if necessary:
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="110" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMInstalled.jpg" width="187"></td></tr>
</table></li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure that the ASCOM software is working correctly with WorldWide Telescope, test it in simulation mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <b>Choose</b> button on the telescope panel, then scroll down the list and select
<b>Simulator</b>:
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="206" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMTelescopeChooser.jpg" width="348"></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
	<li>Now click <strong>Connect</strong> on the telescope panel. You should 
	notice that many of the <strong>Telescope Control</strong> entries are now 
	enabled. The actual buttons that are enabled depends on the setup of the 
	simulator. Click <b>Setup</b> on the telescope panel. Change the <b>Equatorial System</b> entry in the <b>Advanced</b>
	section to <b>J2000</b>:
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="521" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMSetup.jpg" width="654"></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> in the <b>Setup</b> dialog and you should notice that a new window has been opened, the <b>Scope Simulator</b>.
This window mimics the remote control of a physical telescope:
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="351" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ScopeSimulator.jpg" width="138"></td><td>
	<img alt="" height="351" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ScopeSimulatorBlank.jpg" width="138"></td><td>
	Open up the <strong>Scope Simulator</strong> and ensure that there are red 
	numerical position values. If there are not, as seen in the image to the 
	right, then the simulator did not start correctly. If this happens, try closing WorldWide Telescope and then opening it again.</td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>Next click on <b>Search</b> to open up the search panel, then enter <b>Polaris</b> into the search text box. When the
thumbnails appear, double click on <b>Polaris</b> (not <b>Polaris Australis</b>). This will instantly change the WorldWide
Telescope view to the star.</li>
<li>Click on <b>Slew</b> in the telescope panel. You should see the settings on the <b>Scope Simulator</b> change to the 
RA and Dec of Polaris:
	<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="500" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ScopeSimulatorOnPolaris.jpg" width="500"></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>Next select the controls of the <b>Scope Simulator</b> -- one or more of <b>N</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>E</b> or <b>W</b>. Note
that holding down Shift will move the virtual scope slower, and Ctrl even slower. So make some key presses to move the
simulated view. Note the change in RA and Dec.</li>
<li>Click <b>Center</b> in the telescope panel to center the WorldWide Telescope view on whatever the simulated telescope is
viewing. You should see the view smoothly animate to the simulator's settings.</li>
<li>Pressing <b>Traffic</b> on the <b>Scope Simulator</b> will display a window giving a log of the telescope movements:

<tr><td><img alt="" height="517" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ASCOMTraffic.jpg" width="370"></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li>This completes the simulation test.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to set up the physical telescope and your computer in a location that will enable you to align the telescope
correctly. Align the telescope before attaching it to the computer with the USB cable. Telescope alignment can be involved
depending on the technology used by the telescope software. When it is correctly aligned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the computer and telescope have an adequate power supply.</li>
<li>Point the telescope at a well known star, <b>Polaris</b> for example.</li>
<li>Attach the telescope to the computer with the USB cable.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Choose</strong> in the telescope panel, and select the type that best matches your telescope: 
<b>ASCOM Dome Control</b>, <b>Generic Hub</b> and so on.</li>
<li>In <b>Setup</b> check off the items that best match the features of the telescope.</li>
<li>Select <b>Connect</b>, and this should enable the <b>Telescope Control</b> pane of the telescope panel.</li>
<li>Click <b>Slew</b> to change the WorldWide Telescope view to match that of the telescope. Use the <b>Finder Scope</b>
to verify that the WorldWide Telescope view is the same as the physical telescope, <b>Polaris</b> for example.</li>
<li>If the telescope alignment is at any point uncertain, use the <b>Sync</b> option. This transmits the RA and Dec of WorldWide
Telescope to the physical telescope.</li>
<li>Use WorldWide Telescope to locate objects close to the original alignment, then <b>Slew</b> the physical telescope to
the new location to try to view it for real! Alternatively control the physical telescope and use WorldWide telescope to
identify the objects you locate.</li>

<h3><a name="CreatingaNewCollection">Creating a New Collection</a></h3>


<p>A <i>Collection</i> is the term used to describe a WorldWide Telescope data file. You can create your own collections,
either from existing images or perhaps from your own data. As long as the data that the new collection references is available
on the internet, your new collections can be shared.</p>
<p>To create a new collection, either select <b>Explore &gt; New &gt; Collection...</b>, or select 
<b>Collections &gt; My Collections &gt; Add New Item</b>, which has the same 
effect. Enter an appropriate name in the 
<b>Create New Collection</b> dialog box. Your new collection will be added under <b>My Collections</b> and the data will be saved off automatically when you add
new images to it.</p>
<p>To add images to this new collection use the <b>Research</b> option of the <a href="#TheFinderScope">Finder Scope</a>, 
which has an <b>Add to Collection</b> menu entry. If you select the <b>Add New Item</b> 
thumbnail when the new collection is displayed in the
top panel this will add a new <em>folder</em> to your collection, enabling a 
folder and image structure which might be helpful for a large or complex 
collection. Add as many folders and images as you like to the collection. </p>
<p>To edit the metadata for any one of the images, right click the thumbnail
for the image, and select <b>Edit</b>. This will bring up the <b>Edit Object Information</b> dialog:</p>

<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="418" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/EditObjectInformation.jpg" width="275"></td><td>
	Some of the metadata information is populated, including the <strong>
	Constellation</strong> and <strong>RA</strong> and <strong>Dec
	</strong>co-ordinates, when the image is added to the collection. Clicking
	<strong>FromView</strong> will overwrite this with the co-ordinates of the 
	current view, so be careful of clicking this inadvertently.<br><br>Add 
	appropriate <strong>Names</strong> and <strong>Classification</strong>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Your own collections are saved to the <b>My Documents/WWT Collections</b> folder. Each time you add an image to a collection
the file is updated. If a collection is moved to another location, you can open if by browsing to it 
using the <b>Explore &gt; Open</b> menu option.</p>
<p>Note that by right-clicking on an image in one of your collections, the <b>Remove from Collection</b> menu option is available
for you to delete images. To delete or rename a collection, right-click the collection thumbnail. 
To move images around within a collection that contains folders, use the <strong>
Add to Collection</strong> option to add the image to the right folder, then
<strong>Remove from Collection</strong> to delete the image in the wrong folder.</p>
<p>To share your collection with other users, email the .wtml file in the <b>My Documents/WWT Collections</b> 
folder. The users that receive this email can either double click on the wtml 
file (if the file mime types have been set up appropriately) to open up 
WorldWide Telescope with this collection, or simply use <strong>Explore &gt; Open</strong> 
to navigate to and open the collection.</p>

<h3><a name="ComparingForegroundandBackgroundImages">Comparing Foreground and Background Images</a></h3>


<p>Astronomers often use comparisons of images of different wavelengths of an object to help expose information about that
object, such as the type of gasses being emitted, the blue or red-shift, the intensity of x-rays or gamma rays, and so on.</p>
<p>WorldWide Telescope has the concept of a <i>study</i> - usually a single or composite image of one object in space, and a
<i>survey</i> - usually a comprehensive collection of data from a large area of the sky. Typically a study is loaded 
from a <i>Collection</i> by clicking
a thumbnail in the top panel, and a survey is selected from the <b>Imagery</b> list. In this context the study is the 
<i>foreground</i> image and the survey the <i>background image</i>. There are options to reverse this, or to compare two
studies or two surveys, but the study on top of the survey is the default operation.</p>
<p>When both a foreground and background image are in view, the <strong>Image Crossfade</strong> slider appears, enabling you to visually compare
the two images:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="38" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ImageCrossfade.jpg" width="116"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Another method of comparing images is available if there are several thumbnails (studies) of the same object. For example,
select <b>Explore &gt; Collections &gt; Chandra Studies</b> and then scroll to <b>Kepler's Supernova</b>. There are a number
of thumbnails representing different studies of this feature, including the 
visible wavelength and high energy x-rays. To compare the studies without any change in camera position, 
click on the picture icons in the top right hand corner of the thumbnails:</p>

<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="110" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Kepler.jpg" width="567"></td><td>
	<img alt="" height="29" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/PictureIcon.jpg" width="35"><br>The 
	picture icon.</td></tr>
</table>



<p>To change the default operation of a study as foreground and survey as background there are a number of options. 
All default
surveys appear as thumbnails in the <strong>Collections &gt; All-Sky
Surveys</strong> folder. Simply clicking on the thumbnail will load the survey as 
background. However if you right-click on the picture icon, there is the option 
to load the survey as foreground or background. Load one as foreground and one 
as background and the <b>Image Crossfade</b> slider will be enabled to compare the two. 
Similarly two studies can be compared this way.</p>
<p>There are options in the 
<a href="#TheFinderScope"><b>Finder Scope</b></a> to set images as foreground or background, and then there is the 
greater flexibility (and complexity) provided by the SDK (refer to the 
<a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/docs/WorldWideTelescopeDataFilesReference.html">
WorldWide Telescope Data Files Reference</a> document).</p>
<p>Note that not all images of an object are taken from exactly the same camera 
position. Also sky survey images are composite images -- perhaps with 
images taken at different times or even by different telescopes -- so the exact 
location of an object may appear to vary.</p>

<h3><a name="TheFinderScope">The Finder Scope</a></h3>


<p>The <strong>Finder Scope</strong> is a pane designed to help you fix on and 
research a particular object. It can be opened by right-clicking on the view, or 
from the <strong>Explore</strong> menu.</p>
<p>Certain celestial objects, when pointed to, display a circle and a name. This 
indicates that the object is in one of the databases that WorldWide Telescope 
links to. Right-click the object to display the <strong>Finder Scope.</strong> With the <strong>Finder 
Scope</strong>, you can refine your search in the field of view, or research 
your selected object from online references.</p>
<p>You can also view the object&#39;s image from the <a href="#DigitizedSkySurvey">DSS</a> or <a href="#SloanDigitalSkySurvey">SDSS</a> archive, download 
its DSS <a href="#FITSImages">FITS</a> file, or run a <a href="http://www.us-vo.org">USNO</a> NVO cone search for objects near the selected 
object.<br><br>If you find an object you wish to research further, try not to move the <strong>
Finder Scope</strong> as the RA and Dec will change, so if you then click <strong>
Research</strong> for example, this will use the new values and not those of the 
object.</p>
<p>Note also that you can pan by dragging

<h3><a name="SkySurveys">Sky Surveys</a></h3>


<p>Comprehensive surveys of the sky have been carried out at different 
wavelengths to help determine the composition of stars and galaxies. The digital images 
generated by sky surveys are compiled into the data sets that are available in the <b>Imagery</b> 
drop down list, and usually provide the <i>background image</i> to the view.</p>

<p>Each imagery set provides unique information about objects in the sky because the images were taken at different wavelengths of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, and at different times. Different wavelengths expose different energy regimes, stellar processes, and effects. For example, 
with observations made in the low-energy spectrum (radio and microwave), cold processes are exposed: molecules forming or moving about, 
or giant clouds of gas and dust. The optical band (between infrared and ultra violet) exposes gas escaping from black holes, 
volcanoes on the moons of Jupiter, or heat escaping from stellar dust. With x-rays, hot processes become apparent such as explosions on stars, neutron stars, 
comets, supernova remnants, or energy beams emanating from matter falling into black holes. With gamma-rays, even more violent events become apparent,
such as the destruction of atoms, stars spiraling into black holes, supernovas, and pulsars. </p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation is classified as follows:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><h5>Wavelength</h5></td><td><h5>Name</h5></td></tr>
<tr><td>Greater than 10cm</td><td>Radio waves</td></tr>
<tr><td>Between 10cm and 1mm</td><td>Microwaves</td></tr>

<tr><td>Between 10nm and 1/100nm</td><td>X-rays</td></tr>
<tr><td>Less than 1/100nm</td><td>Gamma rays</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Try selecting a specific object or an area of the sky and then changing
<strong>Imagery</strong> to compare 
the object's properties. Astronomers have used the different wavelengths to 
great effect, for example by using the hydrogen alpha wavelength to track stellar red-shift, 
over 250 planets have been discovered. </p>

<p>Below is a description of the <strong>Imagery</strong> sets included in WorldWide Telescope. Note that specific objects are not always visible in every 
imagery set. For example, specific stars identifiable in the Digital Sky Survey are not always visible to the unaided eye in the Hydrogen Alpha 
imagery. Also, the different surveys have been carried out at different resolutions.

		Starting in 1983 the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) - a joint 
		project of the US, UK, and the Netherlands - performed a survey of 98% 
		of the sky at four wavelengths: 12, 25, 60, and 100 m. IRAS led to 
		numerous scientific discoveries spanning a broad range of astrophysical 
		subjects, from comets to circumstellar disks to interacting galaxies. A new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light 
subtraction, an improved calibration and zero level, and from a better de-striping. The data set is used to study the variations 
of dust properties. Several studies of dust emissions at high galactic latitudes 
		show large variations of dust<br>properties depending on the grain sizes 
		of the dust. Large dust clouds are the birthplaces of stars and planets.<br>

<h3><a name="StellarBrightness">Stellar Brightness</a></h3>


<p>The value in comparing and cataloging the brightness of stars was apparent to the ancient Greeks, who developed a system of six magnitudes, the
brightest being level one, the dimmest level six. The difference between each level was roughly <em>twice-as-dim</em>, 
so a level six star would be 32 times as dim as a level one star. This system 
was formalized much later so that a level six star was 100 times as dim as a 
level one star, so the difference between each level became 2.512. As the Sun, 
Moon and Planets were not part of the system to introduce them meant adding 
negative numbers, and to introduce stars that are only visible through 
telescopes the scale was extended far beyond six, and now goes from -26.73 for 
the Sun, to about 30 for the dimmest stars visible using the Hubble Space Telescope. It is an odd scale as it straddles zero, but the only important information in it is the difference between
two numbers when calculating relative brightness - individual numbers on their own have little meaning. The reference point (a magnitude of zero) has
changed from the star Polaris, to Vega, to no star in particular as all stars vary a little in brightness.</p>
<p>The value in this logarithmic scale is that it keeps the numbers in a small range. If the brightness scale was linear and not logarithmic it would have
to extend from zero to one trillion simply to include distant stars (and ignoring the brightness of any object in the Solar System). 
The following image shows the brightness of a number of stars around Canopus 
(the second brightest distant star in our night sky):</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="313" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Brightness.jpg" width="544"></td><td>

	<br>-0.72<br><br>4.39<br><br><br><br>4.4</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The brightness magnitude usually quoted for a star is the <i>apparent magnitude</i>, which is how bright it appears to us on Earth. The <i>absolute
magnitude</i> of an object is how bright it would appear at a standard distance away from the observer (a 
distance which has been fixed at 10 parsecs or 32,616 light years). Both figures 
are often quoted in catalogs of stars, the <a href="#TheFinderScope">Finder Scope</a> quotes only the apparent magnitude. 
Apparent magnitude is often referenced as the letter V, absolute magnitude as 
the letters M<sub>V</sub>.</p>
<p>To calculate the relative brightness of one object to another (either 
apparent or absolute magnitude) use the following C# code:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>
<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">double</span>&nbsp;calculateRelativeBrightness(<span style="color:blue;">double</span>&nbsp;b1,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">double</span>&nbsp;b2) <br />
{ <br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:#2B91AF;">Math</span>.Pow(2.512d,&nbsp;b2&nbsp;-&nbsp;b1)); <br />
 <br />
} <br />
</span></td></tr></table>
<p>Using this program gives the following relative magnitudes of brightness:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">

<h2><a name="EarthAndPlanetResearch">Earth and Planet Research</a></h2>

<p>WorldWide Telescope can be used by Earth scientists to study events on our own planet in some detail. 
The main feature for this purpose is the <strong>Layer Manager</strong>, which 
enables layers of data to be rendered on the 3D model of the Earth, where those 
layers are either static data such as boundaries (political boundaries, 
watersheds, tectonic plate boundaries, to name a few examples), or dynamic data 
reporting events on a time line (earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes and similar 
natural events perhaps being the most dramatic, but simple changes in 
vegetation, sea level, water flow, and so on can also be represented). Static 
data is usually represented by shape files (lists of vectors defining regions, 
large and small), and dynamic data is usually represented by spreadsheet data 
(columns of events, latitude and longitude, times and the magnitude and 
persistence of the event).</p>
<p>Layers can also be applied to the Sun, the other planets, and some of the moons, in 
our solar system.</p>
<p>Layers can be added and used as part of <a href="#GuidedTours">Guided Tours</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="TimeSeriesData">Time Series Data</a></h3>
<p>Time series data is typically a list of events that occurred at a very 
specific time (such as earthquakes), or were initiated at a certain time and 
persist.</p>
<p>To add a layer of time series data, click the <strong>Add</strong> button on 
the Layer Manager, or right-click on the node where the data should be added, 
and select <strong>Add</strong> from the menu; select the file of data to be 
added from the Open File dialog. The import of data from an Excel spreadsheet 
will be made easier if there are column 
headings in the spreadsheet that are helpful, as WorldWide Telescope uses these to make a best guess as to their 
purpose. It does not matter if there are more columns in the spreadsheet than 
are needed - the 
extraneous columns will be ignored. The spreadsheet should be in .csv or .txt 
format.</p>
<p>Following the selection of the appropriate file, a series of Data 
Visualization dialogs will appear that are used to configure the data for 
WorldWide Telescope:</p>
<table class="T3" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td>
	<img alt="" height="371" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/EarthResearch_spreadsheetproperties.jpg" width="722"><br>
	When this dialog appears, first give the data layer a friendly name, and 
	select from the drop down list of coordinate types (often the default of 
	spherical will apply).<br><br>Follow the instructions in the dialogs, 
	carefully matching the column headings in the spreadsheet to those requested 
	by the Data Visualization tool. <br></td></tr>
	</table>

<h4>Setting Time Series Data Running</h4>
<p>To set the time series data running, select and highlight the layer in the
<strong>Layer Manager.</strong> Then ensure the <strong>Time Series</strong> and 
(optionally) the <strong>Auto Loop</strong> checkboxes are selected. Then go to 
the <a href="#TheViewMenu">View Menu</a> and accelerate time to see the 
visualization of the events.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up WorldWide Telescope, and select <b>Earth</b> from the <b>Look At</b> drop down list.</li>
<li>Use the <b>Explore</b> menu to select <b>Open</b> then <b>Shape File</b>. Select the file <i>plates.shp</i> to display the tectonic plate boundaries. Doing this will have the
effect of opening up the <b>Layer Manager</b>.</li>
<li>Open up the spreadsheet <i>Earthquakes 5 plus.xlsx</i> and select and copy all the data, including the headings.</li>
<li>In the <b>Layer Manager</b> pane, click the <b>Paste</b> button.</li>
<li>In the <b>Spreadsheet Properties</b> dialog box, change the name from <i>Pasted Layer</i> to something descriptive such as <i>Earthquakes 5.0 plus</i>. Then click <b>OK</b> to close this 
dialog and add the data layer.</li>
<li>In the <b>Layer Manager</b> right click on <i>Earthquakes 5.0 plus</i> and change the color from white to one of the reds.</li>
<li>For now, deselect the <i>Earthquakes 5.0 plus</i> layer by clicking the checkbox beside it.</li>
<li>Also in the <b>Layer Manager</b> select both the checkboxes <b>Time Series</b> and <b>Auto Loop</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>View</b> pane, in the <b>Observing Time</b> box, massively accelerate the simulated time, perhaps to 10,000,000 times real time. Adjust this later as necessary.</li>
	<li>Note the <strong>Time Scrubber</strong> arrow now moves rapidly and in a loop. It is 
	following the times set in the earthquake data, from the first to the last 
	event, then repeating. The times in the view pane are also following this

<h3><a name="RegionalDataCache">Regional Data Cache</a></h3>
<p>A regional data cache can be set up to improve data download performance on both a small and a large scale. A small scale data cache might be for a classroom of
students, by setting up a local cache on the student network the number of 
simultaneous requests across the internet for one piece of data, a tour perhaps, can be 
greatly reduced. For the student all they have to do is enter a URL using the <a href="#SettingsMenuEntries">Settings Menu Entries</a>.</p>
<p>A large scale data cache could be setup for a region of the world where there is a requirement for a significant amount of data in a local language. 
Again all the users have to do is enter the URL.</p>
<p>In both cases the cache simply maintains a copy of the most recently 
requested data, so if a user requests some data that is available on the cache, 
then it is immediately downloaded from the cache rather than a request sent to 
more distant servers.</p>
<p>Note that the use of a regional data cache will only improve performance if the connection from computers that are to use it is better to the cache than it is to the
specified data servers (such as the WorldWide Telescope data servers), which should certainly be the case on a local area network, but might not be the case across national or regional boundaries. 
Note also that the data is also cached locally on the user&#39;s computer whether a 
regional data cache is in use or not. This means that the improved performance 
of a regional cache is limited to the first use of the data by any user.</p>
<p>To set up a regional data cache, either on a small or large scale, contact the 
<a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/help/SupportHelp.aspx?Page=IssuesAndBugs">WorldWide Telescope support team</a> for details.</p>

<h3><a name="MultiMonitorCluster">Multi-Monitor Cluster</a></h3>

<p>A straightforward example of a multi-monitor cluster is to have a single master computer, and a matrix of slave computers each rendering a portion of the view.</p>
<table class="T3" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="498" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/Cluster1.jpg" width="824"><br>
	Hoag&#39;s Object - a rare ring galaxy - displayed on a 4 x 3 cluster. With a 
	resolution on each monitor of 1920 x 1200 the full image is 27 Megapixels.<br>
	<br>The master computer is shown lower right.<br></td></tr>
</table>

<p>To setup a multi-monitor cluster, go through the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup the hardware required, with each computer installed with WorldWide Telescope. 
Each monitor is run by a single computer, so the hardware setup may take some 
time, and require some additional hardware, such as the support structure shown 
in the image above. The computers must all be linked to the same local network. The identification system
used for a matrix of computers and monitors is shown in the following table (with the four by three matrix shown in the image above used as an example):</li>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td class="style3">0,0</td><td class="style3">1,0</td><td class="style3">2,0</td>
	<td class="style3">3,0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="style3">0,1</td><td class="style3">1,1</td><td class="style3"><strong>2,1</strong></td>
	<td class="style3">3,1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="style3">0,2</td><td class="style3">1,2</td><td class="style3">2,2</td>
	<td class="style3">3,2</td></tr>
</table>

<li>Some of the bios settings for each of the slave computer need to be changed. 
This process is different for each make of computer - on some it involves pressing F2 during the startup process.
This will bring up a bios settings menu, and make the following changes:
<ol type="a">
<li>Ensure the Ethernet card is on. For example on a Dell computer, go to <b>Power Management</b> and set the <b>Low Power Mode</b> setting to <b>Off</b>.</li>
<li>Enable a remote computer to start up this one. For example on a Dell 
computer, also in <b>Power Management</b> set the <b>Remote startup</b> setting to <b>On</b>.</li>
</ol>

<li>Turn off any screen savers on the slave computers.<li>If it is necessary to 
	remotely edit the config.xml files, then enable remote login. The following links may be 
	useful:<br><br>

<h4><a name="RemoteStartingoftheMultiMonitorCluster"></a>Remote Starting of the Multi-Monitor Cluster</h4>
<p>With a large cluster such as the one shown in the image in the previous section, it is helpful to automate the startup and shutdown of all the slave computers from the master.
To do this use the <strong>WWTRemoteControl</strong> utility. For this to work though, go through 
the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the master computer run the <strong>WWTRemoteControl </strong>utility 
program.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Node List</b> button and add the MAC Address (physical address 
component) of each slave computer to the list. To get the MAC Address of a computer, open up a command-prompt
window and type <b>getmac</b>. The address that is required is under the column <b>Physical Address</b> and should be six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens.</li>
<li>When the node list is complete, close that dialog and return to the main dialog.</li>
<li>Click <b>Wake All</b> to turn on all of the slave computers.</li>
<li>When all the slave computers have started, click <b>Launch All</b> to start WorldWide Telescope.</li>
<li>When WorldWide Telescope is up and running on each slave, control the view from the master computer.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Close All</strong> to finish the session and <strong>Shutdown 
All</strong> to shutdown the slave computers.</li>
	<li>The node list is saved to the application properties for the utility, so 
	the next time it is run there is no need to re-enter the node list.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="SingleProjectorPlanetarium">Single-Projector Planetarium</a></h3>
<p>A single projector planetarium is typically a small planetarium up to around 20 feet in diameter. To see plans and instructions for building a planetarium suitable for a small class of students, refer to 
<a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/docs/WorldWideTelescopePlanetarium.html">WorldWide Telescope Planetarium</a>. 
The key to single-projector planetariums is that the output has to be warped in 
such a way that it appears correct on the dome (or geodesic dome). This warping 
is most noticeable in the rendering of lines (rather than spheres). The image 
below shows Saturn and the Milky Way warped for a 16:9 projector.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Full Dome</strong> from the <a href="#ViewMenuEntries">View Menu Entries</a> to initiate 
setup for a small planetarium.</p>

<p>A typical setup for running WorldWide Telescope in a small telescope would be 
to have the software running on a laptop, with a 16:9 projector connected to the 
computer using an HDMI cable. When giving presentations in the planetarium it 
can be helpful to have the image present on both the dome and the laptop screen, 
in order to point out objects of interest with the mouse, for example. If this 
is the case then consider setting the screen resolution of the laptop to match 
the aspect ratio of the projector; the following table shows some common 
options:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><h5>Screen resolution</h5></td><td><h5>Aspect ratio</h5></td></tr>
<tr><td>800 x 600&nbsp;</td><td>4:3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1024 x 768</td><td>4:3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1152 x 864</td><td>4:3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1280 x 720</td><td>16:9</td></tr>
<tr><td>1280 x 960</td><td>4:3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1600 x 1200</td><td>4:3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1920 x 1080</td><td>16:9</td></tr>
</table>


<p>If the option to <strong>Detach Main View to Second Monitor</strong> is used 
then there is no need to match screen resolution with aspect ratio. Also note 
that an <a href="#XboxController">Xbox Controller</a> can be used to navigate in WorldWide Telescope, which can make controlling the view in the dome 
more comfortable.</p>

<h4><a name="CustomWarpFiles">Custom Warp Files</a></h4>
<p>Custom warp files should be used when the aspect ratio of the projector is 
not 16:9 or 4:3, or you are using a variant of the standard fisheye projector. </p>
<p>Warp files have a .data extension and can be created using a third-party tool called <em>meshmapper </em>tool described at the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/miscellaneous/domemirror/wwt/">

<h3><a name="MultiProjectorPlanetarium">Multi-Projector Planetarium</a></h3>

<p>The following section applies to the use of WorldWide Telescope in 
planetariums that use multiple projectors and a blended image. Typically these 
are large and commercial or university planetariums.</p>
<p>Projection into a large planetarium is often done using six projectors, with each projector projecting onto an area of the dome 
- with special blending done to mask the edges. The following diagram shows two 
common six-projector projection layouts:</p>
<table class="T1" cellspacing="8" cellpadding="8">
<tr><td><img alt="" height="490" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/uiimages/ProjectionSixA.jpg" width="980"></td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are two methods of projection that can be configured in WorldWide 
Telescope, the first using P<em>rojection Designer</em> software, the second using an external blending 
system such as <em>Global Immersion<sup>&#65533;</sup></em>. One of the main 
differences between the two is that blending is done by WorldWide Telescope 
when using <em>Projection Designer</em>, but is usually done in dedicated hardware when 
using external blending. The two methods 
require different parameters in the config.xml file.</p>
